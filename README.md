## Description

In the assignments up to this point, we've mainly been manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) by hard-coding HTML. This assignment provided deeper understanding of how to dynamically update the DOM through the use of JavaScript event listeners. By using event listeners, the content displayed on a website is automatically updated based on a specified trigger. Examples of how this works include the buttons used to trigger the starting of a timer, and those used to alter HTML display attributes. 

The benefit of dynamically updated sites is the improved user experience - websites can now respond/change based on what the user chooses to do while visiting the site. With an enhanced user experience, it follows that re-visits and new traffic would increase in response. Through this assignment I was able to get a glimpse of how complex web development can be. Ensuring that all dynamically updated elements function as expected requires lots of experimentation with the code to minimize bugs/errors.
